Topics:

- ARROWS AND SYBOLS
- MATH (mathjax? other js features/libraries?)

Questions:

- `<br>` and multiline breaks (latex)
- straight html
- underline (reuse: doubled underscore/star for bold/ital; <hr>)
- `~` strikethrough (equiv?)
- macros (see next)
- `include` filetype checking?
- comments/actions
- escapes `&amp;`, `&copy;` as & and Â© -- less-than and tags too
- CONTENT: how do we keep all the content? not like wdjc where all content is of known form/reserved/constructed syntax.
- whitespace matters! tabs and newlines are relevant now. but not always maybe? worth keeping in mind: may be trouble at the parser. ---UPDATE: maybe all ID's?
- `<hr>`'s
- maybe even panels and things? code/pre? block quotes? hrm
- footnote style links
