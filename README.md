Questions:

- `<br>` and multiline breaks (latex)
- straight html
- `include` filetype checking?
- comments/actions
- escapes `&amp;`, `&copy;` as & and Â© -- less-than and tags too
- CONTENT: how do we keep all the content? not like wdjc where all content is of known form/reserved/constructed syntax.
- whitespace matters! tabs and newlines are relevant now. but not always maybe? worth keeping in mind: may be trouble at the parser.
- `<hr>`'s
- maybe even panels and things? code/pre? block quotes? hrm
- footnote style links
